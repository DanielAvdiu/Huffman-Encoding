# Huffman-Encoding-Algorithm
This project consists in using the Huffman Encoding Algorithm in order to try and compress data. The algorithm basically assigns the shortest binary code to the character that is mostly repeated, this is accomplished by using a tree sctucture that defines the binary code. The theoretical aspect can be found in the research paper attached.
In the research paper a thorough description is provided for foundations of information theory and how it initially started, and then proceeding to a more in-depth analysis of the Huffman Algorithm with two implementations,
one with C++ and one with Python.
